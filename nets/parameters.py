    Keyword Args:
        mapping (Mapping): A dictionary-like object that maps names to
            children, but with special key-value pairs containing the node's
            data. Defaults to an empty dictionary.
        parent (Tree): The parent tree. Data from each of the data keys is
            inherited from ancestors.

    Attributes:
        name (str | None): Name of the node.
        children (dict): A dictionary of named children.
        parent (type(self)): The parent of this node.
        data (dict): Dictionary containing the data accessible from this node
            (ie the node's data and that inherited from its parents). Keys are
            values of ``self.DATA_KEYS`` (``params`` and ``nest_params``)
        params, nest_params (dict-like): Contain the node data. Syntactic sugar
            to allow access to the node's data.
