# NETS: Network Simulations (in NEST)

## Network

### Definitions

- A **model** is a NEST model (neuron or synapse) with a specific name and set
  of parameters. All models are copied from their respective "NEST model" using
  `nest.Copy()` with their specific parameters. NEST models can be either
  imported from external modules or built-in.
  - Models should have a different name from NEST models.
  - Multiple models can have different names but the same NEST model and
    parameters.

- A **layer** is a NEST topological layer. A layer is akin to a grid of a
  certain dimension (nrows x ncols) and is composed of a given number of nodes
  at each grid _location_. Nodes at each location can be from different models.
  - Only 2D layers are supported.
  - Layers can be of the type `InputLayer` when composed of generators. Input
    layers are automatically duplicated to contain parrot neurons, so that
    recording of generators' activity is possible (via parrot neurons).
    Additionally, the state of generators can be changed before each session to
    reflect the forecoming input stimulus (see "session" description).

- A **population** is a set of nodes of the same model within a specific layer.
  In practice, populations are `(layer, neuron_model)` tuples.
  - Connections are defined between layers or populations (but not at a finer
    grain).
  - Each recorder created in NEST corresponds to a specific population, so it is
    possible to decide to record (or not) each population independently, and to
    record different variables for different populations.

- We call **connection model** a set of parameters describing a certain type of
  projection between node populations. The following types of connection models
  are handled so far:
  - _topological connections_: Connections to be created by
    `nest.topology.Connect()`
  - _connections from file_: Connections between individual units loaded from a
    dump from a previous simulation. Arbitrary unit-to-unit connections are
    handled with this type of connection.
  - _rescaled (topological) connections_: "Rescaled" topological connections
    from a dump from a previous simulation. This allows one to change the
    spatial profile of topological connections between two networks while
    keeping the same number of outgoing connections per node.
  - _multisynapse connections_: TODO document. implements the workaround
      at https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator/issues/904

- We call __connection__ a specific projection between layers or populations.
  Each individual connection has a specific connection model.

## Simulation

### Definitions

- We call **network** a full NEST network, consisting of layers, connections,
  etc. Represented by the `Network()` object.

- We call **session** a period of simulation of a network with specific
  background conditions/inputs. Represented by the `Session()` object.
  - One can change the state of the network before each session by:
    - Modifying the state of all (or part of) the units within a population.
    - Modifying the state of all (or part of) the population-to-population
      connections (synapses).
    - One can change the state of the input layers of the network to mimic the
      presentation of a certain stimulus during that session. This can be done
      by specifying an **input** for that session. An input stimulus is an array
      from which the instantaneous poisson rate of each of the input layer's
      units is derived.
      - If the input has no time dimension, the poisson rate is constant for
        each unit.
      - If the input has a time dimension, the poisson rate of each unit varies
        with time accordingly.

- We call **simulation** a full experiment. Represented by a `Simulation()`
  object (which contains a `Network` object and a list of `Session` objects).

### Overview of a full simulation

1. **Initialize kernel**:
  1. Set NEST kernel
  2. Set random seeds
1. **Initialize network**:
  1. Initialize the `Network` object representing a NEST network: derive the
     dependent parameters from the independent parameters given in the parameter
     files.
  2. Create the network in NEST.
3. **Run each session** in turn. For each session:
  1. Initialize the session:
    1. Load the stimulus
    2. (Possibly) reset the network
    3. Change the network's dynamic variables
    4. Set the input spike times or input rates to emulate the forecoming
       session stimulus.
  2. Call `nest.Simulate()`.
4. **Save the simulation**:
  1. Create or clear the output directory
  2. Write output:
    - Format and save the recorders' data
    - Save some raster plots
    - Plot some connections
    - Dump some connections
    - ... any post-processing you like :)

## Parameters

### `Params` parameter trees

Simulation parameter trees are specified as tree-like `Params` objects. The
hierarchical tree structure provides a concise means of specifying parameters
for nested 'scopes', which inherit parameters from ancestor scopes. The leaves
of the tree specify models, etc. that are instantiated in the simulation.

### Example parameter tree

Below is an example of a YAML file with a tree-like structure that can be loaded
and represented by the `Params` class:

```yaml
network:                # name of node (non-leaf)
  synapse_models:       # name of node (non-leaf)
    params:             # params common to all nodes below 'synapse_models'
      nest_model: static_synapse
    cortical:           # name of node (non-leaf)
      params:           # parameters common to all leaves below 'cortical' node
        target_neuron: bmt_neuron  # NEST model name
        weight: 1.0
      AMPA_syn:         # name of node (non-leaf)
        params:         # parameters common to all leaves below 'AMPA_syn' node
          receptor_type: AMPA
        AMPA_syn:       # name of leaf
        AMPA_syn_to_MC: # name of leaf
            params:     # params of the leaf
                weight: 2.0
      NMDA_syn:         # name of leaf
        params:         # params of the leaf
          receptor_type: NMDA
simulation:             # name of leaf
  params:               # parameters of 'simulation' leaf.
    local_num_threads: 1
```

Each node can have a `params` key containing a dictionary of parameters for that
node. All the keys of a node that are not named 'params' are children nodes. A
leaf is a node that doesn't have children (meaning, its only key is `params` if
it has any). The parameters of a node will be passed along to the children (and
possibly overwritten by them) until we reach a leaf.

In the example above, the leaves of the 'network' subtree and their respective
parameters are as follows:

```yaml
AMPA_syn:
    nest_model: static_synapse
    target_neuron: bmt_neuron
    receptor_type: AMPA
    weight: 1.0
AMPA_syn_to_MC:
    nest_model: static_synapse
    target_neuron: bmt_neuron
    receptor_type: AMPA
    weight: 2.0
NMDA_syn:
    nest_model: static_synapse
    target_neuron: bmt_neuron
    receptor_type: NMDA
    weight: 1.0
```

### Merging trees

`Params` objects can be merged horizontally, meaning the parameters (contents of
the `params` key) of nodes with the same name and at the same position in the
tree are combined in a `ChainMap` _before_ leaves inherit the parameters of
their parent nodes.

During a `nets.run()` call, the following parameters are combined (from lowest
to highest precedence):
- `constants.DEFAULT_PARAMS_PATH`: Default path to a parameter file to load.
- `run(input_path)`: Path to a parameter file to load.
- `run(overrides=<params_object>): A parameter object given directly to `run()`.
- CLI input: Parameters in the file given by the `--input=<path>` command-line
  flag.

### Full parameter tree

The final parameter tree (obtained after merging) must have the following
subtrees/leaves:

NB: Parameters for which no default value is given are _mandatory_ and should be
defined in the final parameter tree.

- `simulation` (leaf): Contains the simulation parameters.
  - The following parameters are recognized:
    - `output_dir` (str or None): Path to the output directory. Can be
      overwritten by the 'output' CLI kwarg, by the `__init__.run()`
      'output_dir' kwarg or by the `Simulation.__init__()` 'output_dir' kwarg.
      (default from `nets.constants`)
    - `input_dir` (str or None): Path to the input. Can be overwritten by the
      'output' CLI kwarg, by the `__init__.run()` 'output_dir' kwarg or by the
      `Simulation.__init__()` 'output_dir' kwarg. Please see the 'Input'
      section for details on how the input is loaded for each session.
      (default from `nets.constants`)
    - `dry_run` (bool): If true, `Simulation.run()` is not called in
      `__init__.run()`. This means that the simulation is initialized and saved
      as usual, but no nest.Simulate() call is performed and the sessions are
      not initialized. (default `False`)
    - `clear_output_dir` (bool): If true, the contents of the subdirectories of
      `output_dir` listed in the CLEAR_SUBDIRS constant (defined in `save.py`)
      are deleted during a `Simulation.save()` call before any saving of output.
      (default `False`)
        - If set to `False`, it is possible that an output directory contains data
          from a previous simulation.
        - If you add subdirectories to the main output_dir don't forget to
          update the `CLEAR_SUBDIRS` variable accordingly.
    - `save_simulation` (bool): If true, `Simulation.save()` is called in
      `__init__.run()` (default `True`)

      (default -1)
    - `delete_raw_dir` (bool): If true, the raw data output by NEST is deleted
      during a `Simulation.save()` call. (default `False`)
    - `save_nest_raster` (bool): If true, NEST raster plots are generated during
      a `Simulation.save()` (default `True`)
    - `dump_connections` (bool): If true, the unit-to-unit synapses are dumped
      during a `__init__.run()` call. Modify the `plot_connection`
      connection_model parameters to dump only a subset of the connections.
      (default `False`)
    - `plot_connections` (bool): If true, population-to-population connections
      are plotted during a `__init__.run()` call. Modify the `plot_connection`
      connection_model parameters to plot only a subset of the connections.
      (default `False`)
    - `dump_connection_numbers` (bool): If true, the number of incoming
      connections by population for each connection type is dumped during a
      `__init__.run()` call. (default `False`)

- `sessions` (subtree): Contains the parameters for each session and the list of
  sessions to be run in order. The sessions are represented by the leaves of
  that subtree. The following parameters are recognized:
  - `order` (list of str): List of sessions to be run during simulation.
    (default `[]`)
  - `reset_network` (bool): Whether to call `nest.ResetNetwork()` before running
    the session (default `False`)
  - `session_input` (bool): Absolute or relative path to a NumPy array defining
    the stimulus for that session. Possibly ignored if the `input_path` session
    parameter points to a NumPy array. Please refer to the 'Inputs' paragraph.
    (default `None`)
  - `time_per_frame` (float): Number of milliseconds during which each 'frame'
    of the input movie is shown to the network. (default `1.0`)
  - `max_session_sim_time` (float): Maximum duration of the session, in ms.
    Actual simulation time of the session is the minimum between this parameter
    and the total duration of the input movie (nframes x time_per_frame).
    (default `float('inf')`)
  - `unit_changes` (list): List of dictionaries describing the parameter changes
    to apply to a proportion of units of specific populations. (default `[]`)
  - `synapse_changes` (list): List of dictionaries describing the parameter
    changes to apply to population-to-population connections within specific
    populations. (default `[]`)

- `network` (subtree): Should contain the following subtrees:
  - `layers` (subtree): Defines layer parameters. Each leaf is a layer. The
    following parameters are recognized for each layer-leaf:
    - `type` (str): `'InputLayer'`, `'Layer'` or `None` (default `'Layer'`).
    - `nrows`, `ncols` (int): Number of rows/columns for the layer (mandatory)
    - `edge_wrap` (bool): Whether the layer is wrapped in NEST. (default
      `False`)
    - `visSize` (bool): NEST physical 'extent' of each the layer's side. We only
      consider square layers for now (possible TODO) (mandatory)
    - `populations` (dict): Non-empty dictionary containing the neuron model
      (keys) and the number of units of that model at each grid location
      (values). (mandatory)
    - `area` (str): Area of the layer. (default `None`)
    - `input_rate_scale_factor` (float or int): Scaling factor for the poisson
      rate applied to an `InputLayer` to reflect a stimulus. (mandatory for
      `InputLayers`)
    - `weight_gain`: Scaling factor for the weight of connections of which the
      considered layer is the _source_. (default `1.0`)
    - `scale_kernels_masks_to_extent`: Whether the kernels and masks of
      connections of which the considered layer is the pooling layer are
      considered to be expressed in 'number of units', rather than physical
      extent. (default `True`).
        - **Important**: Please note that by default the kernel and masks are
          interpreted as being expressed in 'number of units' rather than
          physical extent and are accordingly scaled before being passed to
          NEST.
    - `scale_input_weight`: Whether the weight of connections originating from
      an InputLayer is scaled by number of layers within an InputLayer. (default
      `False`)
  - `neuron_models` (subtree): Defines neuron models. Each leaf is a neuron
    model. All parameters of a leaf are passed to ``nest.CopyModel()`` except
    the following:
    - `nest_model` (str): Base NEST model for the neuron model. (mandatory)
  - `synapse_models` (subtree): Defines synapse models. Each leaf is a synapse
    model. All parameters of a leaf are passed to ``nest.CopyModel()`` without
    change except the following:
    - `nest_model` (str): Base NEST model for the synapse model. (mandatory)
    - `receptor_type` (str): Name of the receptor_type. Used to derive the
      port-in of the connection. If specified, a `target_neuron` parameter is
      expected. (default `None`)
    - `target_neuron` (str): Name of the target neuron. Used to derive the
      port-in of the connection. Ignored if `receptor_type` is unspecified.
      (default `None`)
  - `connection_models` (subtree): Defines the connection models. Each leaf is a
    connection model. The following parameters are recognized:
    - `type` (str). Type of the connection. Recognized types are 'topological',
      'from_file', 'rescaled'. (default `'topological'`).
    - `source_dir` (str). Path to the directory containing the previously dumped
      connections. Used (and mandatory) only if the connection is of type
      'from_file' or 'rescaled'. (default `None`)
    - `scale_factor` (float). Scaling factor for the kernel and masks. (default
      `1.0`)
    - `dump_connection` (bool): Whether connections of that connection model
      should be dumped during a `Simulation.dump_connections()` call. (default
      `False`)
    - `plot_connection` (bool): Whether connections of that connection model
      should be plotted during a `Simulation.plot_connections()` call. (default
      `True`)
    - `weight_gain` (float): Scales the connection's synapse model's default
        weight. The actual connection weight is equal to the synapse defaults,
        multiplied by this parameter and possibly the source layer's
        `weight_gain` parameter.
    - The other parameters define the topological or rescaled (topological)
      connections and will be passed to nest.topology.ConnectLayers() (for
      topological) connections, possibly after kernel and mask scaling.
      These parameters are ignored in the case of connections 'from_file', and
      interpreted similarly in 'rescaled connections' as in topological
      connections.
    - **Important**: There shouldn't be a `weight` entry in these parameters!
        The weight is set from the synapse defaults and scaled by the source
        Layer's and the Connection's `weight_gain` parameters.
    - **Important**: For each connection model, if the
      `scale_kernels_masks_to_extent` parameter of the pooling layer is true,
      the masks and kernel sizes specified in the parameters (and scaled by the
      `scale_factor`) are interpreted as "number_of_units" rather than physical
      extent.
  - `topology` (leaf): Should contain a `connection` parameter consisting in a
    list of individual population(/layer)-to-population(/layer) connections.
    Each individual connection should be a dictionary with the following fields:
    - source_layer (str): source layer. (mandatory)
    - source_population (str or None): source pop. If not specified, the
      connection originates from all the populations in the source layer.
      (default `None`)
    - target_layer (str): target layer. (mandatory)
    - target_population (str or None): Target pop. If not specified, the
      connection targets all the populations in the target layer. (default `None`)
    - connection (str): Name of the connection model. (mandatory)
  - `recorders` (subtree): Defines recorder models. Each leaf is a recorder
    model. All parameters of a leaf are passed to ``nest.CopyModel()`` except
    the following:
    - `nest_model` (str): Base NEST model for the recorder model.
  - `populations` (subtree): Defines the populations (= models within a specific
    layer). Used to define which population is recorded by what type of
    recorder. Leaves are individual populations. The name of populations-leaves
    should be the corresponding neuron model. The following parameters are
    expected or recognized:
    - `layer` (str): Name of the layer for that population. (mandatory)
    - `recorders` (dict): Dictionary of which the keys are the models of
      recorders that will be created and connected to that population, and the
      values are dictionary (possibly empty) containing overriding parameters
      for the corresponding recorder.
    - `number_formatted` (int): Number of units per grid location that are
      for which recorder data is formatted. All units are formatted if None.
      (default None)
    - **NB**: Make sure that no population is missing compared to the `'layer'`
      parameters.


## Inputs to the network

The input 'shown' to the network (that is, used to set the firing rates during a
forecoming session) is a NumPy array of dimensions compatible with the network's
`InputLayer`'s dimension. The NumPy array should be 4D with the following
dimensions: `(rows, columns, filters, frames)`
- _rows_ : should be greater than the number of rows of the `InputLayer`.
- _columns_ : should be greater than the number of columns of the `InputLayer`
- _filter_ : should be greater than the number of Layers in the `InputLayer`.
  Please ignore this dimension in general cases but make sure your array is 4D.
  This dimension would correspond to different filters to be applied to an image
  to mimic different 'filterings' by the retina, LGN, V1 etc in an object
  recognition network.
- _frames_ : If the stimulators are spike_generators, successive 'frames' are
    shown to the InputLayer, each for a certain duration. If the stimulators
    are poisson_generators, only the first frame is shown to the network.

##### From input arrays to firing rates

If InputLayer stimulators are poisson generators, the rates are set according
proportionally to the first 'frame' of the input array. The other frames are
ignored.
If InputLayer stimulators are spike generators, the instantaneous rates at each
time are set proportionally to the frame corresponding to that time. Each frame
is 'shown' to the layer for a certain duration (`time_per_frame` parameter).
In both cases the scaling factor from np-array values to rates is given by the
'input_rate_scale_factor' parameter of the InputLayer.

### Loading of the input arrays

The input stimulus "shown" to the network is loaded using the following steps
during the initialization of each session:

1. (option 1): If the `input_path` simulation parameter is an absolute path
    pointing towards a NumPy array, this array will be loaded for all sessions.
    Otherwise...
2. (option 2): If the `session_input` session parameter for the considered
    session is an absolute path pointing towards a NumPy array, it will be
    loaded for that session. Otherwise...
3. (option 3): If the `input_path` simulation parameter is a path pointing
    towards a directory, and the `session_input` session parameter can be
    interpreted as a relative path, from the `input_path` directory, pointing
    towards a NumPy array, it will be loaded for the session.
4. (option 4): Just for reference, there is another type of loading that is
    specific to our usage and doesn't need to be developed upon right now. We
    will probably migrate the corresponding code outside of the package in the
    future.

In summary, if an absolute path to an array is specified in the command line
`input` optional argument, it will be used for all sessions. Otherwise, a good
approach is to specify the absolute path to an 'input directory' in the
nets.constants, leave the `'input_path'` simulation parameter otherwise
unspecified and specify the relative path (from the `'input directory'`) to each
session's input in the session parameters.

## Run the simulation

### To run **from Python** (_e.g._ in a Jupyter notebook):

#### Using the ``Simulation`` object to run the simulation step by step:

```python
import nets

# The simulation parameter file to use.
params_path = 'params/default.yml'

# User defined list of tree-like overrides
# First override is ignored (just an example)
override1 = {}
# Second override sets the number of NEST threads
override2 = {'kernel': {'params': {'local_num_thread': 10}}}
# Leftmost is applied last and precedes.
overrides = [override2, override1]

# Load the parameters and apply the overrides
params = nets.load_params(params_path, *overrides)

# You can also override the input and output settings in the parameter file by
# passing them as kwargs when you create the simulation:
input_dir = None  # Path to an input directory. NOTE: This can also be a path
                  # to a saved NumPy array.
output_dir = None # Path to output directory.

# Create the simulation.
sim = nets.Simulation(params, input_path=input_path, output_dir=output_dir)

# Run the simulation.
sim.run()

# Save the results, dump the connections, etc.
sim.save()
sim.dump()
```

#### Using the ``nets.run()`` function to run the full simulation at once:

```python
import nets

# The simulation parameter file to use.
params_path = 'params/default.yml'

# User defined list of tree-like overrides
# Leftmost is applied last and precedes.
overrides = []

# The __init__.run() function knows which steps to run or not by reading the
# 'simulation' parameters.
nets.run(params_path, *overrides, input_dir=None, output_dir=None)
```

**NB**:
- `DEFAULT_PARAMS_PATH` from `nets.constants` parameters are applied when
  loading the parameters during a `__init__.run()` call.
- Control which stimulation steps are run during a `__init__.run()` call by
  setting the simulation parameters.

### To run directly **from the command line**:

A command line package call is equivalent to a `__init__.run()` call. Notes in
the above paragraph apply.

To run a simulation from the command line:
```bash
python -m nets <param_file.yml> [-i <input>] [-o <output>]
```

## Outputs of the simulation

All the simulations outputs are saved in subdirectories of the directory
specified in the `output_dir` simulation parameter.
